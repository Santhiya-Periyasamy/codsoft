In this game , the  player has to guess a number which was generated by the computer within the range 1-100.
It has two levels. At easy level one can guess infinite times until they get the correct answer. In difficult level  one can limit their own chances to guess hence choosing their difficult level by own
During the game, the game comments on whether the guessed value is high or low than the actual generated value.

Since C++ doesn't contain the function to generate a random number , I rand() function from cstdlib library is used . srand(time(0)) function is also used with the help of ctime library to create different random numbers. This function changes the seed each time the program runs.
Remaining parts of the code is handled by do-while , if-else and for loop control statements.
